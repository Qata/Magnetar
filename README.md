# Magnetar

Magnetar is a simple yet powerful file transfer remote for iOS 15 and above.

## Features

⚠️ *EXTREMELY UNDER CONSTRUCTION*⚠️
Some features do work but they are yet to be integrated. To use it as is, you will need programming skills and to describe the endpoint of your file transfer server.

* View a list of file transfers on a single server.
* Dispatch commands against individual transfers, like start, stop, pause, remove, etc.

## Planned Improvements

Magnetar will have a lot of quality of life improvements that were sorely lacking from BarMagnet.

| Capability | Barmagnet  | Magnetar |
| ------------- | -- | -- |
| Accessibility | ❌ | ✅ |
| Better server timeout handling | ❌ | ✅ |
| Better server configuration debugging | ❌ | ✅ |
| Localisation  | 🇬🇧 | 🇬🇧 🇩🇪 🇫🇷 🇪🇸 🇨🇳 |

BarMagnet was the first iOS app I ever created (and it started as a macOS app even before then).
I was totally blown away by its popularity, but it was just a pet project to scratch an itch. 
Magnetar will be built with my near-decade of experience in the iOS industry and will have the good design to show for it.
