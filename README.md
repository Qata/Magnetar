# Magnetar

Magnetar is a simple yet powerful torrent remote for iOS 13 and above, iPad OS 13 and above and macOS 15 and above.

## Features

* It doesn't even do anything yet! Extremely under construction!

## Planned Improvements

Magnetar will have a lot of quality of life improvements that were sorely lacking from BarMagnet.

| Capability | Barmagnet  | Magnetar |
| ------------- | -- | -- |
| Accessibility | ❌ | ✅ |
| Better server timeout handling | ❌ | ✅ |
| Better server configuration debugging | ❌ | ✅ |
| Localisation  | 🇬🇧 | 🇬🇧 🇩🇪 🇫🇷 🇪🇸 🇨🇳 |

BarMagnet was the first iOS app I ever created (and it started as a macOS app even before then).
I was totally blown away by its popularity, but it was just a pet project to scratch an itch I'd had about a lack of good torrent remotes on iOS. 
Magnetar will be built with my full 8 years of experience in the iOS industry and will have the good design to show for it.
